This directory contains development artifacts and historical files that are not needed for production deployment but are preserved for reference.

## Contents

### development/

### logs/
- Historical log files from development and testing

## Purpose

These files provide:
- Development history and context
- Test verification and evidence
- Reference for future enhancements
- Audit trail of development process

## Note

**For production deployment, you only need:**
- `addons/` directory (modules)
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `config/` directory
- `docs/` directory (documentation)
- `README.md`

Everything in `_archive/` is optional reference material.
