        OPS MATRIX DEMO DATA - REMOVED FOR PRODUCTION
        =============================================
        All demo data has been purged for clean production installs.
        This file is kept for module structure compatibility.
        
        Demo data should NOT be created automatically.
        Users create their own data via Setup Wizards.
